For the past few weeks, I have been getting familiar with the gear that I had to purchase.</p>\n<p>It seems silly, but trying to figure out which goggles, headlamp, and shorts to buy, all took much more time than anticipated.  I wish someone just handed me a list of things to buy, but I must’ve missed that email, so I had to research each item.</p>\n<p>For example, I had no idea that tight swimming shorts are called jammers (right-side in picture).  Nor, did I know that there are tri-shorts (left-side) designed for swimming, biking, running, with padding in the butt area.</p>\n<p>Also, because I train during dark, cold nights, I had to buy bike leg warmers, gloves, hat, and a headlamp.  If you have any recommendations for me, or would like links to products below, let me know.</p>\n<h3>Run / Bike / Run Training</h3>\n<p>This past Saturday, there was a run/bike/run training about 4 miles away from where I live.  Since I don’t have a car, I had to ride my new bike there (this was only my 2nd time on the bike).  Less than a mile later, I noticed that my tire was running a little low on air.</p>\n<p>But, I was prepared.  Someone advised me that I should buy and take along a bike pump during my rides.  All good, right?</p>\n<p>Newbie error…I didn’t realize that the valve of the pump and the tire didn’t match.  So instead of filling the tire with air, I let all of the air out.</p>\n<p>If I was few years younger, I probably would’ve cried.</p>\n<p>I almost started to walk back home with the bike, but I took a deep breath and started running to the training location 3 miles away…with the bike by my side.</p>\n<p>It was a great decision.  As soon as I arrived, coach and mentor quickly filled my tire with air, and even reconfigured my pump so that the value matched (all I had to do was flip around the pump’s value….doh!).</p>\n<p>I had an awesome workout, burned some calories, then consumed back those calories afterwards during breakfast with great company of fellow TNT participants, mentors, and coaches.  GO TEAM!</p>\n<p>Keep on running!\nKenny</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Lavaman - Meet My New Gear","date":"December 20, 2011","description":"New toys, new experiences."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2011-12-13-lavaman-reason-fundraising/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reason Why I'm Fundraising & Training"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2012-01-14-lavaman-domo-arigato/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lavaman - Domo Arigato"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"99635f51-cac7-57c0-b88a-c685be04ead0","previousPostId":"f2916b59-4b5b-5031-97f3-60dd9e034417","nextPostId":"a6269c7b-06da-53ad-960c-79b44e377e4c"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
