It wasn’t because they didn’t want to be supportive, it’s because I did not tell them. When I was diagnosed, my dad was going through radiation and chemo treatments for his gastric (stomach) cancer. Eventually, I ended up telling my dad, mom, and sister 4 years later. They all freaked out and we had our unforgettable emotional family moment. Sorry guys, I love y’all.</p>\n<p>I want to thank Amy for being the best life partner. You found out that I had cancer less than a month after our wedding, and all those times you drove me to the doctors, radiation treatments, and putting up with my emotional swings will never be forgotten. I love you.</p>\n<p>I am sharing this story because fight for cancer is a battle we have not yet won. It affects millions of people around the world.</p>\n<p>Here are some stats around blood-based cancers (Leukemia, Lymphoma, and Myeloma) in America:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every 4 minutes, an American is diagnosed with blood cancer</li>\n<li>Every 10 minutes, this disease takes the life of an individual</li>\n<li>Leukemia is the most common type of blood cancer in children</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After 5 years of being cancer-free, I promised myself to participate in LLS and Team in Training event to celebrate my 5-year survival mark, and also contribute to the cause for a cure.</p>\n<p>In 2010, I fundraised with Team in Training, and managed to run a full marathon. Cancer didn’t kill me, but I felt like marathon training almost did. :) See the full story <a href=\"http://pages.teamintraining.org/wa/Amica10/kleewn\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This season, I’ll be serving both as a triathlon participant, and an ‘honored teammate (cancer survivor)’ to thank the fundraising team. I learned how to run last year, but I can barely ride a bike, and swimming will be my biggest challenge. I’ll be sharing my new experiences as I progress through the training.</p>\n<p>I will be fundraising/training for 2 people.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>My dad, who survived both gastric and colon cancer in the past 8 years, during 2 different times. Although he did not have ‘blood-cancer’, much of the research can be used for both blood and non-blood based cancers. Love you dad. I’m so glad we both beat it.</li>\n<li>An awesome career mentor of mine, David Parker’s mom recently passed due to Leukemia. This is for the Parker family.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep on running,\nKenny</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Reason Why I'm Fundraising & Training","date":"December 13, 2011","description":"My story as a cancer survior."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010-11-29-first-marathon/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My 1st Marathon - Team in Training"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2011-12-20-lavaman-new-gear/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lavaman - Meet My New Gear"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"bb19c877-5c5e-52e8-986e-dba192394fa3","previousPostId":"5cd10ce2-c049-5c91-b34a-6566328f7ef1","nextPostId":"b48ce443-4933-592d-8e70-1c6948fca449"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
