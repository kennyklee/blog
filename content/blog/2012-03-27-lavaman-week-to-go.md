Less than a week until the triathlon in Hawaii…

### Fundraising
I’m 80% there.  $3,215 of $4,000 goal.  I have few more bucks trickling in, but I don’t think I will raise 100% of my goal.

I’ll just be blunt…if you haven’t donated, please donate. It’s for a good cause.  It really is.  It’s being used for lifesaving research to cure blood cancers!!!

### Team Bank of America
I have to give my employer, Bank of America, and my co-workers a big shout-out.  About 1/3 of my fundraising comes from Bank of America because of gift matching.  Not every participant is lucky enough to have employer gift matching, so I am very fortunate.
Did you know that Bank of America has our own TNT team?

The BofA TNT spring team is now about 30 strong.  We literally have people from coast to coast—from the Washington/Alaska chapter to the Northern & Central Florida chapter.  So far, the team has raised approximately $26,000 to fight blood cancer.  That is AWESOME!

Also, over the past three years, there have been over 250 Bank of America employees who have completed a Team in Training event while raising over $650,000.  Take that, blood cancers!

### Training
Bad news.  With less than a week to go, I’m sick.  I’m sneezing, coughing, can’t sleep, can’t concentrate.

My body usually bounces back from colds pretty quickly, but I think I’m still living in the past, when I was few years younger.

I’m pretty sure that inception of the cold is from a 27mi bike ride 2 Saturdays ago, when it started snowing when I was about half way done with the bike ride.

It’s a very beautiful moment when nice snow flurries starts falling.  However, as soon as you start gaining some speed on the bike, those same snow flurries start feeling like angry little torpedos aimed straight for your face and eyeballs.  It didn’t help that I had fleece jacket and gloves which absorbed water like Shamwow.

As soon as I got back home, I jumped into the bathtub and dipped myself into near scalding hot water.  It felt SOOO good, but I think the damage has been done.

Just this past Saturday, the Lavaman team got together for a final bike/run training.  We also dropped off our bikes to ship to Hawaii, and receive instructions for the triathlon weekend.  We also received our way-too-tight triathlon tanks.  This is the only time I’ll be wearing a baby tee.

No, that asian guy in the middle is not me.  Derek would be very disappointed if we were mistaken for each other.  He is training for the Ironman.  Yes, the real, full Ironman.

### Final Thoughts: Pre-My-1st-Triathlon
I’ve come a long way since I signed up for this triathlon in Aug ‘2011.  I’ve learned how to swim correctly (at least in my mind), bought my 1st road bike and learned about cycling, and experienced joys of training outdoors during the winter season.

But, I’m still scared s***less.  That’s right, I can admit it and I’m okay with it.

I’m happy that I’m doing something new, challenging, exciting…something that takes me out of my comfort zone.

What about you?  Tell me about it next time we chat.

Keep on tri-ing!
Kenny

P.S. I’ll do a last blog update post-triathlon / vacation.  No later than April 15th.  TTYL.
