Hello. Here is some information about me.

I'm a co-founder at <a href="https://aigen.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Aigen</a>. We're on a mission to regenerate healthy soil at a planetary scale. We are using robotics and artificial intelligence to help farmers grow sustainably and regeneratively.

I'm learning how to be a sustainable organic farmer at <a href="https://vivafarms.org/practicum-in-sustainable-agriculture-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Viva Farms</a> in Woodinville, WA.

Previously, I co-founded Weblife, a cybersecurity company focused on striking a balance between security and privacy. It was acquired by <a href="http://proofpoint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Proofpoint</a>. Before that, I worked for Bank of America and Deloitte, protecting people and companies in the digital world.

I enjoy spending my non-working hours with my partner and 2 kids.

**Journey Map:** Seoul, Staten Island, Brooklyn, Durham, Guam, East Lansing, Troy, Los Angeles, Seattle
