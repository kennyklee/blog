Almost 7 years ago, I was diagnosed with cancerâ€¦Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

It was a difficult experience for Amy (wife) and I because we went through it without the support of my immediate family. It wasn't because they didn't want to be supportive, it's because I did not tell them. When I was diagnosed, my dad was going through radiation and chemo treatments for his gastric (stomach) cancer. Eventually, I ended up telling my dad, mom, and sister 4 years later. They all freaked out and we had our unforgettable emotional family moment. Sorry guys, I love y'all.

I want to thank Amy for being the best life partner. You found out that I had cancer less than a month after our wedding, and all those times you drove me to the doctors, radiation treatments, and putting up with my emotional swings will never be forgotten. I love you.

I am sharing this story because fight for cancer is a battle we have not yet won. It affects millions of people around the world.

Here are some stats around blood-based cancers (Leukemia, Lymphoma, and Myeloma) in America:

* Every 4 minutes, an American is diagnosed with blood cancer
* Every 10 minutes, this disease takes the life of an individual
* Leukemia is the most common type of blood cancer in children

After 5 years of being cancer-free, I promised myself to participate in LLS and Team in Training event to celebrate my 5-year survival mark, and also contribute to the cause for a cure.

In 2010, I fundraised with Team in Training, and managed to run a full marathon. Cancer didn't kill me, but I felt like marathon training almost did. :) See the full story [here][tntblog].

This season, I'll be serving both as a triathlon participant, and an 'honored teammate (cancer survivor)' to thank the fundraising team. I learned how to run last year, but I can barely ride a bike, and swimming will be my biggest challenge. I'll be sharing my new experiences as I progress through the training.

I will be fundraising/training for 2 people.

1. My dad, who survived both gastric and colon cancer in the past 8 years, during 2 different times. Although he did not have 'blood-cancer', much of the research can be used for both blood and non-blood based cancers. Love you dad. I'm so glad we both beat it.

2. An awesome career mentor of mine, David Parker's mom recently passed due to Leukemia. This is for the Parker family.

Keep on running,
Kenny
